            There is nothing lesser than defending (the truth).”</h2>

        <p id="par-1" class="text">I’m an aspiring backend developer with a passion for problem-solving and building
            efficient digital systems. Currently, I’m pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science
            at Macaulay Honors College, where I’m honing my skills in backend development and software architecture.</p>

        <p id="par-2" class="text">Beyond tech, I’m also an entrepreneur, launching a new social marketing business with
            a strong backend focus. I enjoy diving deep into Islamic research and seeking knowledge,
            which keeps me grounded and continuously learning. Some of my favorite books include the
            Qur’an—with Surah Ar-Rahman holding a special place in my heart—Never Finished by David Goggins,
            and books on discipline and self-mastery.</p>

            I’m always driven by innovation, efficiency, and excellence.</p>
